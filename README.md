Idea
=======

Have a self explaining and convinient API that allows *reading* banking data using the German HBCI standard (resp. FinTS). Though that standard is already implemented in the project https://github.com/hbci4j/hbci4java/, the usage is quite complicated. 

# hbci-easy
Easy API to retrieve account and banking information of a bank that implements the HBCI standard such as the DKB.

# Usage
Most problably will change very soon.
